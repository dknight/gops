# gops

The most simple terminal todo utility in the World.

* Simple
* Stupid
* Concrete

![Smart-ID in Go language](https://github.com/dknight/gops/blob/main/files/gopher-gops.svg?raw=true)

## What? Why?

Around the World, there are tons of todo-like software. Why do we need to
make another? Because I desperately need a simple, convenient to-do list
in terminal. The software should be as simple as possible and usable with
only a few keystrokes.

## gops?

The name **gops** is ambiguous:

1. gops might mean 'go-operations' aka 'go-todolist'.
2. gops might be [Gopink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopnik), which I like
more ðŸ˜€.


## Install

A command tool `gops` will be built into `$GOPATH/bin/`.

```
go install github.com/dknight/gops/...
```

## ClI usage

```
Usage of gops:
  -c uint
        Number of the task to complete.
  -f string
        File of stored todo items. (default /home/xdkn1ght/.config/gops/default)
  -l    Display todo-lists.
  -n string
        Set name of the new todo task.
  -t    Set list to today's date.
  -u    Display only incomplete items.
  -v    Displays the version
```

### Make a new item

```sh
gops -n "Make a soup"
gops -n "Drink beer and eat semki"
```

### Complete an item
```
gops -c 2
```

### List all items completed and incompleted
```
gops -a
```

### Some cli usage examples

Use different list rather than default.

```sh
gops -n "Make training at gym" -f training
gops -n "Buy healthy food" -f lifestyle

gops -f lifestyle

```

Save and read to file with today's date.

```sh
gops -t -n "Today go to dentist"
gops -t
```

## Testing

```go test```
